    'The Aglona Roman Catholic Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is one of the most important Catholic spiritual centers in Latvia and the only basilica with "Basilica Minoris" status in the country. Built between 1768-1780 in late Baroque style with Italian influences, it features two magnificent 60-meter-high towers and richly decorated Rococo interior with groin vaults, arches, and ornate columns. The basilica houses the miraculous 17th century icon "Our Miraculous Lady of Aglona", believed to have healing powers and only unveiled during religious celebrations. Every year on August 15th, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and beyond gather to celebrate the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. Pope John Paul II visited in 1993, and the site was declared a Sacred Site of National Importance by Latvian Parliament in 1995. The complex includes beautiful prayer gardens, holy water springs, and a 10-meter Christ statue.',
