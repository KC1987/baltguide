    'The Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB) is an internationally renowned opera house and performing arts center located in a magnificent neoclassical building at Aspazijas boulevard in Riga. Originally constructed as the Riga German Theatre in 1863 by architect Ludwig Bohnstedt, this iconic white building has a rich cultural heritage spanning over 160 years. The venue is famous for being the workplace of Richard Wagner, who served as Kapellmeister from 1837 to 1839. The opera house features four distinct performance spaces: the Great Hall with 946 seats, the New Hall with 300 seats, the Dress Circle Hall with 170 seats, and the Red Hall with 100 seats. During the season running from September to May, LNOB presents nearly 200 performances annually, including an average of six new productions balancing opera and ballet genres. The theater underwent extensive reconstruction from 1990-1995 and again in 2001 when modern annexes were added. Notable ballet dancers who have graced its stage include Mikhail Baryshnikov, Maris Liepa, and Alexander Godunov, bringing international fame to Latvian performing arts. The building is strategically located on the bank of the Riga Canal near the Freedom Monument, surrounded by beautiful gardens that enhance its architectural splendor. LNOB employs approximately 600 people and maintains its status as one of the most important cultural institutions in the Baltic region, regularly participating in international tours and festivals.',
