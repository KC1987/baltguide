    'The Freedom Monument (Latvian: Brīvības piemineklis) is a 42.7-meter-tall granite and copper monument in the heart of Riga, commemorating soldiers killed during the Latvian War of Independence (1918-1920). Unveiled on November 18, 1935, and funded entirely by public donations, this iconic landmark has become the most important symbol of Latvia''s freedom, independence, and sovereignty. Designed by sculptor Kārlis Zāle with the project "Mirdzi kā zvaigzne!" (Shine Like a Star), the monument features 56 sculptures arranged in 13 groups across four levels, depicting Latvian culture, history, and values. At its pinnacle stands a 9-meter copper figure of Liberty, affectionately known as "Milda," holding three gilded stars representing Latvia''s historical regions: Kurzeme, Vidzeme, and Latgale. The monument''s base bears the inscription "Tēvzemei un Brīvībai" (For Fatherland and Freedom). During Soviet occupation, gatherings at the monument were strictly forbidden, though it remarkably survived demolition attempts. Today, it serves as the focal point for national celebrations, public gatherings, and official ceremonies, with an honor guard from the National Armed Forces standing watch and changing every hour from 9am to 6pm.',
