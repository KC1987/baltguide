Create a new supabase db entry for location "National opera". Analyse the json file for entry structure, then search the web for relevant info about location.
"address" should include Street, City, Country and post code if available.
"phone" is an array which may contain 1-3 phone numbers in "text" format.
"url" may contain only location's personal website, or government / county url, or wikipedia url. If none is available, keep it empty string.
"quote" a simple and concise description about location, should't exceed one simple sentence.
"rating": 1-5 with 0.5 step. If possible, search the web for people reviews, and generate rating based on them.
"images" ARRAY with jsonb for each image. Each jsonb contains the following keys: "url", "caption". Use only images from unsplash, pixabay, pexels, and government websites. NOT WIKIPEDIA.
"admission_fee" and "opening_hours" may contain extensive descriptions about detailed explanations if they are available.
"tags" is array which MUST contain ONLY tags from the tagList.ts file attached. This is a strict requirement with no exceptions:

Browse the tagList.ts file and identify which categories the location belongs to
Select appropriate tags EXCLUSIVELY from those category arrays in tagList.ts
Do NOT create, modify, or use any tags that are not explicitly listed in the tagList.ts file
Do NOT use generic terms, location names, or descriptive words as tags
Maximum 3-5 tags should be selected from the approved categories
If a perfect match doesn't exist in the tagList, choose the closest available alternative or use fewer tags
Double-check that every tag in your final array exists exactly as written in the tagList.ts file

Working example file is attached for reference.
Do not generate any extra columns which are not included in json schema.
Generate supabase compatible sql code as output, it will then be used to add data to the table called "locations".
CRITICAL SQL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:

ALL array columns (phone, price_range, images, categories, wifi, parking, accessibility, audience_range, tags) are of type jsonb[] in the database
For empty arrays, use: ARRAY[]::jsonb[]
For arrays with string values, each string must be quoted and cast to jsonb: ARRAY['"value1"'::jsonb, '"value2"'::jsonb]
For phone numbers: ARRAY['"+371 12345678"'::jsonb, '"+371 87654321"'::jsonb]
For images array with JSON objects: ARRAY['{"url": "...", "caption": "..."}'::jsonb, '{"url": "...", "caption": "..."}'::jsonb]
For single-value arrays: ARRAY['"single-value"'::jsonb]

Output sql code should be ready to use, and may not contain any inputs or comments which may cause command to crash.
